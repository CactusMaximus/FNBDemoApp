# FNBDemoApp


This is a simple change calculation app that does the following:
1) Calculates change in both notes and coins
2) Checks if amount input is greater than the required amount
3) Will not return any change if there isn't any
4) Will tell the user how much more to put in if the input amount is not sufficient
